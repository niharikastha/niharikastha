# 👋 Hi, I'm Astha Niharika  
### Full Stack Developer | AI & LLM Engineer | Node.js • Next.js • RAG Systems

I’m a Software Developer Engineer (SDE-1) at **Hyscaler (NetTantra Group)**, where I build  
**AI-powered systems, full stack applications, scalable backends, and high-performance data pipelines** for enterprise clients.

I’ve engineered RAG systems that reduce LLM hallucinations by **65%**, developed document processing pipelines for **10,000+ documents**, built multi-threaded job systems handling **10K+ records/day**, and developed applications served to **100K+ users**.

## 🚀 What I Do

### 🔹 **AI & LLM Engineering**
- RAG systems using vector databases (pgvector, Redis Vector)  
- Hybrid search (dense + sparse) with 40% faster retrieval  
- LLM integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral)  
- Document processing pipelines (Docling + Celery)  
- Embedding workflows, metadata tagging, semantic ranking  

### 🔹 **Full Stack Development**
- Enterprise applications with **Next.js, React, Tailwind, Redux**  
- Real-time chat, notifications, WebRTC, WebSockets  
- Scalable frontends optimized for performance & SEO  

### 🔹 **Backend Engineering**
- Node.js, Nest.js, Express.js  
- Distributed workers using Node.js Worker Threads  
- REST & GraphQL APIs  
- Role-based access control, authentication, multi-tenancy  
- High-volume data processing (10K+ records/day)
